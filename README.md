## Here are some of my favorite lab assignements from this semester.



# Assignment 4
I created an interactive pizza. The pepperoni will appear with you press down on a key. [Lab Assignment 4](https://github.com/bradripp/MAGD150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab04_Ripp) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Assignment 5

I created a TV with a box boucing around the screen. It is also interactive. If you click on the button that says "square," it will color in the box. [Lab Assignment 5](https://github.com/bradripp/MAGD150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/%20f21magd150lab05_Ripp)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bradripp/MAGD150-Projects/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
